## Problem and Solution Overview

## Initial Paper Prototype

![paper prototype overview](/img/annotatedoverviewpp.jpg)

We developed our initial paper prototype using sticky notes and simple drawings. We used a piece of tape on our template to hold down the sticky notes, which tend to curl up. We had only 7 screens, which we used to support our two tasks: Facilitate conversation about art and Receive rewards/validation. Both of these tasks are supported by the two main functions of InterprArt: recording interpretations and listening to interpretations. Thus, the structure of our prototype begins with a home screen on which the user selects either Listen or Record, and subsequent screens then support that choice. The Listen and Record branches do intersect at certain points, like if a user chooses to record a  response to an interpretation she is listening to. In this initial iteration of our prototype, the Facilitate Conversation task consisted of: selecting Listen (screen A), choosing a category of interpretations to listen to (Screen B), noticing that a Chain Listen screen has appeared (indicating a pre-existing conversation thread), selecting a numbered response to listen to (Screen D), and choosing to respond or not to the thread(Screen E). Our Receive Validation task consisted of: selecting Record (Screen A), using the recording screen to submit your interpretation (Screen F), and noticing that you have received a star for your interpretation if it met some criteria (Screen G).

## Digital Mockup

Above is an overview image of our digital mock up, which included screens supporting our two main tasks: Facilitate conversation about art and Receive validation. The Facilitate Conversation task consisted of: selecting Listen (screen B), choosing a category of interpretations to listen to (Screen C), listening and using the arrows and controls to navigate between interpretations and play/pause/fast-forward/rewind (Screen D), noticing that a Chain Listen screen has appeared and choosing to listen or not (Screen E), and then listening the thread and choosing to respond or not (Screen F). Our Receive Validation task consisted of: selecting Record (Screen B), using the recording screen to submit your interpretation (Screens G and H), noticing the error-prevention pop up (Screen I) and Submitted pop up (Screen J), and noticing that you have received a star for your interpretation (Screen K), and reading the explanation pop-up if it was your first one (Screen L). 

We made only minute changes in transitioning from our paper prototype to digital mockup because we have revised our prototype so thoroughly. On our listening screen, we moved the location of the Respond button because the dimensions of our watch differed from the prototype and it no longer fit well next to the ear icon. In addition, we created a unified color scheme for all of our screens and chose one font (Skia) to be represented all throughout our smartwatch application. We also designed unified/consistent home buttons, back buttons, exit buttons and play/pause button. In creating the record screen, we also decided to rearrange the elements. In our paper prototype, the Submit button was off-center, next to the record screen. In our usability testing, one of our participants hit the back button before pressing submit. We chose to handle this by including an error-prevention pop-up warning. We decided to also move this button so that it is below the recording button and timer. We feel this will add a more logical flow to the screen, as it suggests a more clear order of actions.

Pink and red are two key colors in our logo design, but in attempting to include these as prominent features in our digital mock up, we ended up with an unsophisticated and somewhat garish color scheme. In a future iteration, we would use the following color scheme (adjusting our logo to match), generated on coolors.co:

This scheme maintains the general idea of our original color scheme, but refines it and tones it down.
