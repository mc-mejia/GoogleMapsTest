# Usability Testing Review

## Our Three Usability Tests

### First Test

### Second Test
For our second usability test, we used a procedure very similar to the first. The test took place in an empty room in Paresky, where we could have quiet and privacy, while still feeling free to speak aloud. We used the same painting and prepared interpretations as the first test, though we (the group members) changed roles (the wizard became the facilitator, the facilitator became the notetaker, and the notetaker became the wizard). After the first test, we chose to create a pre-recorded response thread for our Community Chat function, and we used that for this test. Another slight difference from the first test was that we chose to ask the participant to conduct each of our 2 main tasks directly, rather than let her decide freely. We did this because we wanted to ensure that we had a chance to show her each screen. In the course of our testing, we encountered a few moments of confusion (i.e. opportunities for revision). First, our user was confused when after submitting a recording, there was no feedback screen. The submit button was greyed-out again, but this feedback was not explicit or noticeable enough to signify that her response was submitted. Then, while listening to a community chat, our participant was confused by the forward and backward arrows. These arrows are meant to navigate between responses, but she thought they would change the screen. And finally, she did not fully understand the Star Reward screen. She thought it meant someone had rated her response highly, when it really means sheâ€™s been using InterprArt a lot or very well.
