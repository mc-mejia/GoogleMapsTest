# Digital Mockup 

## Prototype:




## Changes:

We made only minute changes in transitioning from our paper prototype to digital mockup because we have revised our prototype so thoroughly. On our listening screen, we moved the location of the respond button because the dimensions of our watch differed from the prototype and it no longer fit well next to the ear icon .In addition, we created a unified color scheme for all of our screens and chose one font (Skia) to be represented all throughout our smartwatch application. We also designed a unified home button, back button, exit button and play/pause screen.	
In creating the record screen, we also decided to rearrange the elements. In our paper prototype, the Submit button was off-center, next to the record screen. In our usability testing, one of our participants hit the back button before pressing submit. We chose to handle this by including an error-prevention pop-up warning. We decided to also move this button so that it is below the recording button and timer. We feel this will add a more logical flow to the screen, as it suggests a more clear order of actions.
