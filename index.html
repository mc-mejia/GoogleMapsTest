<h1><strong>The Problem</strong></h1>

<image src="/img/problemcomic.PNG" alt="comic depicting bored museum goer">

<p> The comic pictured above was inspired by a real quote during one of our contextual inquiries. Many people feel
	start to feel bored in museums due to the quiet environment and the passive nature of looking at art,
	and they have their own "time limit". Museums are an important part of any community, as a way to share culture
	and information with the public. A lack of knowledge, interest, and comfort in museums limits the accessibility
	of the incredible cultural resource that museums provide. Our goal when we set out to create InterprArt was 
	to bring engagement and understanding to the museum experience by facilitating conversation between users on 
	a digital platform. </p>
	
<h1><strong>The Process</strong></h1>
	
<h1><strong>The Solution</strong></h1>
	
<p> We have chosen to do this with a mobile application that allows users to track and save their paths through the museum while recording the pieces that catch their eye and saving them to a personal profile – in this way we give users the agency to try different paths through the museum and get creative with how they explore while recording everything that catches their eye. The application generates bespoke, interpretively designed routes that are both maps and artwork in their own right – these routes depict the users physical movement through the museum and note special places that the user chose to memorialize by taking pictures. The application also affords the option to send an image of a route or a favorite object to oneself or a friend.</p>
