<h1><strong>The Problem</strong></h1>

<p> SWCMA tackles the problem of wayfinding at WCMA – whether within the gallery walls or in the collection of over 15,000 objects, our aim is to make our users the deciders of their own experience and give them ways to remember it that are both meaningful and tangible.</p>
	
<h1><strong>The Process</strong></h1>
	
<h1><strong>The Solution</strong></h1>
	
<p> We have chosen to do this with a mobile application that allows users to track and save their paths through the museum while recording the pieces that catch their eye and saving them to a personal profile – in this way we give users the agency to try different paths through the museum and get creative with how they explore while recording everything that catches their eye. The application generates bespoke, interpretively designed routes that are both maps and artwork in their own right – these routes depict the users physical movement through the museum and note special places that the user chose to memorialize by taking pictures. The application also affords the option to send an image of a route or a favorite object to oneself or a friend.</p>
