<h1><strong>The Problem</strong></h1>

<image src="img/problemcomic.PNG" alt="comic depicting bored museum goer">

<p> The comic pictured above was inspired by a real quote during one of our <a href="http://mc-mejia.github.io/HCIGroupProject/CI-review/">contextual inquiries</a>. Many people feel
	start to feel bored in museums due to the quiet environment and the passive nature of looking at art,
	and they have their own "time limit". Museums are an important part of any community, as a way to share culture
	and information with the public. When people feel unknowledgeable, uninterested, and uncomfortable in museums,
	they are unable to access the incredible cultural resource that museums provide. Our goal when we set out to create InterprArt was 
	to bring engagement and understanding to the museum experience by facilitating conversation between users on 
	a digital platform. </p>
	
<h1><strong>The Process</strong></h1>

<h1><strong>The Solution</strong></h1>
	
<p> Our smartwatch application will ask visitors about the meaning of a work of art and allow users to respond conversationally, giving them a mental jolt (a reminder to engage with the art) without detracting and distracting from the experience of viewing the art itself. By allowing visitors to listen to the interpretations of other museum guests, we will assist in the mission of fostering community based upon important cultural relics and make the act of interpretation collaborative and joyful. In addition, by rewarding users when they submit interpretations, we will offer a concrete incentive for people to enter this community while bolstering viewers'confidence in their ability to view art critically.
