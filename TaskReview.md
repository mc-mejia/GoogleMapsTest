# Task Review

## Facilitate Collaboration and Conversation About Art 

New Task

Difficulty level: hard

Amelia likes to spark conversation by sharing controversial opinions. She feels like she learns through formulating arguments
and loves to have spirited debates with friends. When she visits museums, she often feels that they are eerily quiet. She gets
restless and becomes eager to leave. She wishes that she could share her thoughts about the art she sees with others--having
discussions about the pieces would help her feel more stimulated and interested in the artwork.

## Create a More Mentally Active Museum Visit

New Task

Difficulty level: medium

Dennis does not know what to think about when he looks at a piece of art. When he goes to a museum, he feels like everyone
around him can stare at pieces for endless periods of time and he wishes he knew what they were thinking about. He feels 
self-conscious when he walks around the gallery too quickly and tries to stand in front of each work for an “acceptable” 
period of time. This anxiety makes his museum trips feel prolonged and unstimulating. He wishes that he had a task or question 
he was trying to answer when he studied the art work. If he had something concrete to think about with each work of art, he 
thinks he would feel less stressed out and bored in museums. 

## Walk Through the Museum Without Guidance

Old Task

Difficulty level: easy

Henry hasn’t spent much time in museums, but bored on a rainy Sunday afternoon, he wanders over to WCMA to explore. When he enters, he is presented with multiple possible directions to wander, and he pauses for a moment. The greeter behind the desk seems like she’s about to ask him a question, but wanting to avoid a possible guided tour or manufactured museum experience, Henry quickly chooses to go upstairs, avoiding the help of the greeter. Once upstairs, Henry is drawn into an exhibit because the music playing inside sets it apart from the other rooms. He lets himself wander aimlessly, not forcing himself to look at every piece, and only inspecting the ones that naturally catch his eye. He notices other visitors reading plaques, but isn’t interested in absorbing this information. Henry wants to think his own thoughts and experience the art independently of a predetermined perspective.

## Use an Interactive and Educational Game to Teach

New Task

Difficulty level: hard

Maggie is a high school teacher and she wants to try out a unit with her students about art history. She brings them to the art museum, and the group goes on a guided tour. Many of the students don’t seem to be listening to the tour guide, and nobody takes notes. Maggie worries that her students aren’t engaging with the art, and wishes there was a way they could bring their own thoughts to the table while also learning historical content. Coming to the museum seemed better than a powerpoint presentation, but now Maggie thinks she needs to make this field trip even more interactive.
