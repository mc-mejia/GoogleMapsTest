##Facilitate Collaboration and Conversation About Art 

New Task

Task Difficulty: hard

Amelia likes to spark conversation by sharing controversial opinions. She feels like she learns through formulating arguments
and loves to have spirited debates with friends. When she visits museums, she often feels that they are eerily quiet. She gets
restless and becomes eager to leave. She wishes that she could share her thoughts about the art she sees with others--having
discussions about the pieces would help her feel more stimulated and interested in the artwork.

##Create a More Mentally Active Museum Visit

New Task

Task Difficulty: medium

Dennis does not know what to think about when he looks at a piece of art. When he goes to a museum, he feels like everyone
around him can stare at pieces for endless periods of time and he wishes he knew what they were thinking about. He feels 
self-conscious when he walks around the gallery too quickly and tries to stand in front of each work for an “acceptable” 
period of time. This anxiety makes his museum trips feel prolonged and unstimulating. He wishes that he had a task or question 
he was trying to answer when he studied the art work. If he had something concrete to think about with each work of art, he 
thinks he would feel less stressed out and bored in museums.
