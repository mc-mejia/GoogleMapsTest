# Usability Testing Checkin


## Plan for Future Tests

Since our project is intended for college students or young people that are novices to the museum-going experience, we will target other college students for our usability tests. We hope to find more holes in our design or feedback on how to improve the overall flow of the process to complete either one of our tasks. The small screen on the apple watch forces us to think carefully about every visual element that we add to the screen. Too many buttons or text and the user will be overwhelmed by the tiny size of our text and images. During a usability test, Grace will be the wizard that mimics the transition of pages depending on the person's actions, Abby will be the one to conduct the usability test and assist the participant with any confusion, and Maria will be the notetaker and human actor for the community thread. We intend to record our usability test mostly as practice using different testing methods. Also, we will ensure that we do not guide the participant on the process for completing a task and only assist with smaller questions that do not pertain to our test.
