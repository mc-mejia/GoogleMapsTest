# Design Review 1x2

## Design
We chose to pursue our Smartwatch design because it’s mobility allows for visitors to use the product while roaming through the museum. In addition, this design seemed less intrusive than a cellular app. It was brought up in class that museum administrators are concerned about cell phone usage in museums detracting from appreciation of the art. We wanted to utilize the audio features of the smartwatch and limited graphic interface in order to encourage visitors to look and engage with the art while still receiving a degree of prompting from our product. In order to maximize the appeal of our product to users based on our contextual inquiry data, we wanted to be sure to center collaboration and validation in our design. In this vein, we decided that our two tasks should be “facilitate conversation and collaboration about art” and “receive rewards and validation for interpretations.” Because we are targeting art amateurs who tend to get bored in museums, we wanted to create a stimulating way for visitors to engage with the museum without distracting them and preventing them from looking at the art itself. Our watch will allow for a more social, vibrant and affirming visit that does not place a screen between the user and the art. Based on our contextual inquiry data, art amateurs are primarily looking for more conversation in the stilted museum environment and need motivation to actively engage with the museum’s works. Our reward system will encourage users to think critically about the art and will validate their interpretations giving them confidence in their ability to view a work of art. 

## Task 1 Storyboard: Facilitate Collaboration and Conversation About Art

![Collaborate Storyboard](/img/Task1Story.png)

This storyboard shows a visitor enterring the museum. The visitor either pulls out his or her personal smartwatch or borrows one from the museum. Then the visitor collaboratively interprets the art, adding their own ideas to a larger conversation about the piece and receiving inspiration from the ideas of other visitors.

## Task 2 Storyboard: Earning Rewards

This storyboard shows a visitor interpretting a work of art by speaking to the smart watch. Based on the interpretation, the user recieves points which they can cash in as a discount at the gift shop!
